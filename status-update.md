# Anton v2 - Status Update

## Fixes Applied

### âœ… Environment Configuration
- Created proper `.env` files for orchestration and frontend
- Configured to use local Claude CLI without API keys
- Set correct database paths and Redis configuration

### âœ… Database Setup
- Fixed DATABASE_URL configuration
- Database now properly initializes and connects
- Migrations successfully applied

### âœ… Service Startup
- Updated `start.sh` script with proper environment handling
- Added port cleanup to prevent conflicts
- Database initialization check added
- Services now start correctly:
  - Frontend: http://localhost:3001
  - Orchestrator: http://localhost:3002

### âœ… Claude Code Integration
- Updated `ClaudeCodeManager.ts` with correct CLI parameters
- Configured for headless execution with proper output formatting
- No API keys required - uses local Claude CLI

### âœ… WebSocket Issues
- Disabled conflicting raw WebSocket connection
- Socket.io properly configured with CORS
- Connection errors resolved

## Current Working Features

1. **Frontend Application** âœ…
   - Loads successfully at http://localhost:3001
   - Retro circuit board UI displays correctly
   - Project dashboard functional

2. **Orchestrator Backend** âœ…
   - Running at http://localhost:3002
   - Health endpoint responding
   - API endpoints accessible
   - Database connected

3. **Redis & Job Queue** âœ…
   - Redis connected
   - Queue workers active

## Known Issues & Limitations

### ðŸŸ¡ Partial Functionality
1. **Project Persistence**
   - Projects created in frontend are stored locally
   - Backend sync happens but projects created via UI don't fully persist
   - Direct API project creation works correctly

2. **Circuit Board Editor**
   - Opens but can't load locally-created projects
   - Backend-created projects should work

### ðŸ”´ Not Yet Tested
1. **Flow Execution**
   - Claude Code agent execution not fully tested
   - Preview services not verified
   - Real-time monitoring needs testing

## How to Use

### Starting the System
```bash
cd /Users/wesjorgensen/Programming/Anton
./start.sh
```

### Creating Projects (Via API - Works)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Project",
    "description": "Project description",
    "flow": {
      "nodes": [],
      "edges": []
    }
  }'
```

### Stopping the System
```bash
./stop.sh
```

## Next Steps for Full Functionality

1. Fix frontend project creation to properly sync with backend
2. Test Claude Code agent execution with a simple workflow
3. Verify preview services (terminal and web)
4. Test full workflow from project creation to execution
5. Add proper error handling for failed API calls

## Configuration Files Created

- `/orchestration/.env` - Backend environment variables
- `/anton-visual-editor/.env.local` - Frontend environment variables
- Database at `/orchestration/prisma/dev.db`
- Claude projects stored at `/tmp/anton-agents/`

The system is now functional for basic operations and ready for testing Claude Code agent execution workflows.
