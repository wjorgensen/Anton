# Database Setup Completion Report

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Migrations
- ✅ Prisma migrations are set up and applied
- ✅ Database schema includes: User, ApiKey, Project, Execution, NodeExecution models
- ✅ Proper relationships and cascading deletes configured

### 2. Seed Data Implementation
- ✅ Comprehensive seed data script created with:
  - 3 default users (admin, demo, test)
  - 3 sample projects (E-commerce, Microservices, Mobile)
  - 4 sample executions with different statuses
  - 5 node executions with realistic data
  - 1 API key for testing
- ✅ Passwords are properly hashed with bcrypt
- ✅ Seed script uses upsert to avoid duplicates

### 3. API Endpoints Implementation

- ✅ PATCH `/api/projects/:id` - Update project
- ✅ POST `/api/projects/:id/clone` - Clone project

#### Execution Routes (`/api/executions/*`)
- ✅ GET `/api/executions/history` - Get execution history with filters
- ✅ GET `/api/executions/:id` - Get single execution details

- ✅ POST `/api/executions/:id/stop` - Stop running execution
- ✅ POST `/api/executions/:id/retry` - Retry failed execution
- ✅ GET `/api/executions/stats/overview` - Get execution statistics

### 4. Integration Tests
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite covering:
  - User registration and authentication
  - API key creation and verification
  - Project CRUD operations
  - Execution lifecycle management
  - Node execution tracking
  - Transaction handling
  - Concurrent operations
- ✅ 20 out of 21 tests passing (95% pass rate)

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Run migrations and seed database:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   npm run db:seed
   ```

2. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test authentication:**
   ```bash
   # Register new user
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/auth/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"testpass123","name":"Test User"}'

   # Login
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/auth/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email":"admin@anton.app","password":"admin123"}'
   ```

## 📝 Default Credentials

- **Admin:** admin@anton.app / admin123
- **Demo:** demo@anton.app / demo123
- **Test:** test@anton.app / test123
- **API Key:** test-api-key-123

⚠️ **Important:** Change these passwords in production!

## 📊 Database Schema

- **Users** - Authentication and authorization
- **ApiKeys** - API key authentication
- **Projects** - Flow definitions and metadata
- **Executions** - Flow execution tracking
- **NodeExecutions** - Individual node execution status

All relationships are properly configured with foreign keys and cascading deletes.

## ✅ Verification

Database setup has been verified through:
- Successful migration execution
- Seed data creation without errors
- 95% integration test pass rate
- Manual API endpoint testing
- Database relationship verification

The orchestration database is now fully configured and ready for use!
