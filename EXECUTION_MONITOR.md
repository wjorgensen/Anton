### Key Features
- **Modular design** with separate concerns for each view
- **TypeScript** with comprehensive type definitions
- **React hooks** for state management and side effects
- **Real-time updates** via WebSocket integration
- **Performance optimized** with useMemo and useCallback
- **Accessibility compliant** with proper ARIA labels

## 🔧 Integration

### WebSocket Events
The system integrates with the existing WebSocket service to provide real-time updates:
- `node:update` - Node status changes
- `execution:progress` - Progress updates
- `execution:completed` - Execution completions
- `execution:failed` - Execution failures
- `metrics:update` - Performance metrics

### Metrics Service
Leverages the existing Prometheus metrics service for:
- Execution duration tracking
- Resource usage monitoring
- Success/failure rate calculations
- Token usage and cost estimation

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Setup
```tsx
import EnhancedExecutionMonitor from './components/ProjectDashboard/EnhancedExecutionMonitor';

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <EnhancedExecutionMonitor
      executions={executions}
      projectName="My Project"
      executionHistory={history}
      errors={errors}
      analyticsData={analytics}
      isRunning={isRunning}
      onRun={handleRun}
      onPause={handlePause}
      // ... other handlers
    />
  );
}
```

### Demo Component
A fully functional demo is available at `ExecutionMonitorDemo.tsx` with:
