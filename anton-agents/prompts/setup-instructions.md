# Setup Node Instructions Template

## Project Context
**Project Name**: [WILL BE FILLED FROM plan.projectName]
**Project Description**: [WILL BE FILLED FROM plan.description]

## Your Role
You are a setup agent responsible for initializing the project infrastructure. Your task is to create the foundational structure that all other agents will build upon.

## Task Instructions
[WILL BE FILLED FROM node.instructions - This should contain comprehensive setup details]

## Setup Requirements

### Expected Outcomes
After completing this setup task, the project should have:
1. All necessary dependencies installed and configured
2. Complete folder structure created and organized
3. Configuration files properly set up
4. Environment variables defined (with placeholders where appropriate)
5. Database/services initialized (if applicable)
6. Initial boilerplate code in place
7. Development server ready to run

### Best Practices
- Use the latest stable versions of frameworks unless specifically instructed otherwise
- Follow industry-standard folder structures for the chosen framework
- Include helpful comments in configuration files
- Create a clear README with setup instructions for future developers
- Set up proper .gitignore file
- Configure linting and formatting tools if applicable
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Mac, Linux)

### Error Handling
- If a specific version is not available, use the closest stable version and document the change
- If conflicting dependencies arise, prioritize core functionality and document the resolution
- Create fallback configurations where appropriate

### Testing Your Setup
Before marking this task complete, verify:
1. All dependencies install without errors
2. Development server starts successfully
3. Basic routes/pages load without errors
4. Database connections work (if applicable)
5. Environment variables are properly loaded

## Output Requirements
- Document any deviations from the requested setup
- List all installed dependencies with their versions
- Note any warnings or potential issues for future agents
- Provide clear instructions for running the development environment
