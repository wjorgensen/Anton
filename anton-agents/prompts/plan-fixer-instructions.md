## Your Task

Review and fix the plan that was just generated at `.anton/plan/plan.json`.

1. **Load the existing plan**
2. **Check for structural issues** (see your system prompt for detailed checks)
3. **Verify requirements coverage** against the original prompt above
4. **Fix any issues found**
5. **Save the corrected plan** back to `.anton/plan/plan.json`

Focus on fixing errors and adding missing critical components. Do not completely redesign the plan.

After fixing, confirm with: "Updated plan saved to .anton/plan/plan.json"
